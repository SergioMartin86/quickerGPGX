GPGX Compare is a repository for testing and benchmarking a possible improvement to the [Genesis Plus GX (gpgx)](https://github.com/ekeeke/Genesis-Plus-GX) core. The main aim is to improve the performance of headless re-recording for TASing and botting (See: [JaffarPlus](https://github.com/SergioMartin86/jaffarPlus)) purposes. It will be also be used as testbed for proposing and update to the GPGX core in [BizHawk](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk).

Improvements
-------------

- Remove all warnings
- Decentralize include structure
- Made the core thread safe
- Revamp the state saving/loading procedures to be 100% deterministic
- Updating the code to modern C pratices
- Adding automated tests and coverage analysis
